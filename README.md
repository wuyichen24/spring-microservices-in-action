This repository contains the source code of the book "[Spring Microservices in Action (John Carnell)](https://www.manning.com/books/spring-microservices-in-action)" and the personal summary of technical essentials about Spring Boot for microservices.

## Overview
This source code was re-organized by the [original source code](https://www.manning.com/downloads/1578) of the book and I make sure each module is runnable.

## Structure
![](https://github.com/wuyichen24/spring-microservices-in-action/blob/master/readme/pics/whole_structure/whole_structure.png)

- **Servers**
   - [Config](https://github.com/wuyichen24/spring-microservices-in-action/wiki/Config-Server): Provide the configuration parameters for other services.
   - [Eureka](https://github.com/wuyichen24/spring-microservices-in-action/wiki/Eureka-Server): Service discovery.
   - [Zipkin](https://github.com/wuyichen24/spring-microservices-in-action/wiki/Zipkin-Server): Collect tracing data.
   - [Zuul](https://github.com/wuyichen24/spring-microservices-in-action/wiki/Zuul-Server): API gateway.
- **Services**
   - [Licensing](https://github.com/wuyichen24/spring-microservices-in-action/wiki/Licensing-Service): Manage (CRUD) license records.
   - [Organization](https://github.com/wuyichen24/spring-microservices-in-action/wiki/Organization-Service): Manage (CRUD) organization records.
   - [Authentication](https://github.com/wuyichen24/spring-microservices-in-action/wiki/Authentication-Service): Issue and validate access tokens, manage clients' and users' credentials and roles.
   - [Special Routes](https://github.com/wuyichen24/spring-microservices-in-action/wiki/Special-Routes-Service): Provide an alternate endpoint for a certain service.
- [**Database**](https://github.com/wuyichen24/spring-microservices-in-action/wiki/Database): Store license and organization records, clients' and users' credentials, alternate routes of any service.
- [**Message Queue (Kafka)**](https://github.com/wuyichen24/spring-microservices-in-action/wiki/Message-Queue): Notify the licensing service about any organization record modification.
- [**Cache (Redis)**](https://github.com/wuyichen24/spring-microservices-in-action/wiki/Cache): Cache any organization record which has been loaded before.
- [**Log Server**]()
   - [Splunk](https://github.com/wuyichen24/spring-microservices-in-action/wiki/Splunk-Server): Collect log information in local.
   - [Papertrail](): Collect log information in cloud.

## Differences to The Original Source Code
- Use Gradle as Java build automation tool rather than Maven.
- Use MySQL as database rather than PostgreSQL.
- Change the port of the organization service to 8060 to avoid the address conflict with the licensing service.
- Change the port of the special routes service to 8040 to avoid the address conflict with the licensing service.
- Change the port of the authentication service to 8901 to make it same with the example in the book.
- Add the integration of Splunk for log aggregation locally (use both local Splunk and remote Papertrail).
- Use the original functionality in Logback for sending the log to the log servers (Splunk & Papertrail) rather than the solution in the Book (use Logspout to direct the docker output to the log servers).
- Replace the user_roles table by the authorities table for storing users' credentials to DB.
- Change the column name from user_name to username for the user_orgs table and the users table.
- Add comments to make the code easy to read.
